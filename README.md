🌸 Hey there — thanks for stopping by! 👋
Welcome to my little corner of GitHub ✨

I’m just getting started on my GitHub journey, learning as I go and sharing projects along the way. I'm passionate about growing in my career, picking up new tech skills, and finding fun in the everyday hustle.

Here, you’ll find:
🛠️ Small projects and experiments I’m building
📚 Things I’ve learned while exploring new tools and workflows
🌱 A few personal reflections from my life in tech (and beyond)

Whether you're here to learn, connect, or just explore — I’m so glad you’re here. Let’s grow together, one repo at a time 🌿

You bring the snacks, I’ll bring the code. 🍪💻
